Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
Baby don't you know now
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
The way you do the bop
Like a spinnin' top
The Pachuco Hop
And the L.A. Slop
You make a street car stop
At the soda shop
And my eye-balls pop
When I see my
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
Mama don't you know now
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
The way you boogie all night
You're my heart's delight
You know I wish I might
Get a tiny bite of your
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, I wanna, I wanna
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, I wanna, I wanna
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, I wanna, I wanna Jelly Roll
Bop bop bah, Bop bop bah
Bop bop bah, Bop bop bah
Sha-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la
(Cough, cough, cough)

Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
Baby don't you know now
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
The way you do the bop
Like a spinnin' top
The Pachuco Hop
And the L.A. Slop
You make a street car stop
At the soda shop
And my eye-balls pop
When I see my
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
Mama don't you know now
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, got my eyes on you
The way you boogie all night
You're my heart's delight
You know I wish I might
Get a tiny bite of your
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, I wanna, I wanna
Jelly Roll Gum Drop, I wanna, I wanna
Jelly Roll Gum Drop
